# Cloud Resource Cleanup and CI/CD Implementation

Regularly perform audits of our cloud resources to identify and remove unused or unnecessary resources. This practice helps optimize costs, streamline resource management, and maintain a lean and efficient cloud infrastructure.

## Resource Cleanup Strategies

- Identify and list all cloud resources currently in use.
- Analyze resource utilization and access patterns.
- Set up automated processes to identify and flag unused resources.
- Establish policies and schedules for resource cleanup and removal.

# CI/CD Implementation

Establish a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate code deployment, ensuring efficient, reliable, and consistent deployment processes.

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup

- Choose a CI/CD tool or platform that suits development environment.
- Configure automated build, test, and deployment stages in pipeline.
- Integrate version control systems to trigger CI/CD processes upon code changes.

By regularly cleaning up cloud resources, we can ensure efficient resource usage and cost savings.
By implementing a CI/CD pipeline, we can streamline code deployment and ensure reliable and efficient releases.
