# Codebase Refinement

Improve code quality and maintainability through regular code reviews and refactoring. Eliminate redundancy, remove unused code, and ensure a lean and efficient codebase that reduces complexity and enhances long-term development.

## Refactoring Example

Consider the following code snippet as an example of codebase refinement:

**Original Code:**

```python
if not row:
    return False
# type 0 means mcs and type 1 means other kind of rewards like tshirts
if row[0] != 0:
    return False
# if 0 mcs then dont run the queries
if row[1] == 0:
    return False
```

**Refactored Code:**

```python
reward_type, mcs_amount, _ = row
if not reward_type == 0 or mcs_amount == 0:
    return False
```
By refactoring the code, we've achieved greater clarity and reduced redundancy, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
By consistently refining our codebase, we ensure a strong foundation for ongoing development and system maintenance.
