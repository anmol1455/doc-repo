# Service Integration

Enhance system efficiency by consolidating and integrating various smaller services into a unified service architecture. This approach streamlines maintenance, reduces overhead, and creates a more cohesive and manageable system.

## Integration Examples

As part of the service integration effort, consider the following examples:

- **Aggregated Panel for Mods Operations:**
  Create an aggregated control panel that centralizes all mods operations, making it easier for moderators to manage content and user interactions.

- **Merging APIs:**
  Example - We can integrate `t2.php` functionality into mods APIs to provide a consistent and unified backend for different features.

- **User Roles and Access Control:**
  Implement different user roles within the mods system to ensure varying levels of access and permissions for different user types.

- **Insights Dashboard:**
  Add an insights dashboard to the mods panel to provide data and analytics related to templates, campaigns, and other relevant metrics.

By consolidating and integrating services, we can create a more cohesive and efficient system that benefits both users and administrators.
