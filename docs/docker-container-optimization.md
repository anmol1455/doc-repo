# Docker Container Optimization

Enhance the efficiency and performance of our Docker containers by refactoring and streamlining services. This optimization process focuses on reducing container size, eliminating unnecessary dependencies, optimizing build processes, and utilizing multi-stage builds to achieve faster deployment times and more efficient resource utilization.

## Container Optimization Strategies

- **Dependency Analysis:** Identify and remove unnecessary dependencies that contribute to bloated container sizes.

- **Build Process Optimization:** Streamline build processes by minimizing the number of layers, reducing the size of images, and optimizing build commands.

- **Multi-Stage Builds:** Utilize multi-stage builds to separate build-time dependencies from runtime components, resulting in smaller final images.

By optimizing our Docker containers, we can achieve more efficient resource utilization and faster deployment, ultimately improving the overall performance and scalability of our application.
