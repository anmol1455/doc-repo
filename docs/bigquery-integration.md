# BigQuery Integration

Leverage Google BigQuery for efficient processing and analysis of larger tables, ensuring optimized performance and scalability. Partitioning and segmenting tables further enhance data manageability.

## BigQuery Migration Example

As part of our enhancement strategy, consider migrating tables such as votes, shares, comments, and mvc to BigQuery for improved handling of large datasets:

- **Comments Table:**
  Move the `comments` table to BigQuery for improved processing and analysis of comment-related data.

- **Mvc Table:**
  Leverage the capabilities of BigQuery for the `mvc` table to handle MVC-related information effectively.

## Benefits of BigQuery Integration

- Faster query execution for large datasets
- Improved data analysis and insights
- Enhanced scalability and performance

By integrating BigQuery into our system, we can efficiently handle large datasets and gain valuable insights from our data.
