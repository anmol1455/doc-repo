# Implement Comprehensive Caching

Enhance system performance and improve user experience by integrating caching mechanisms at various levels, including services and functions. This involves reducing redundant computations and database calls, resulting in faster response times.

## Caching Query Example

Consider the following queries that retrieve data from the database:

```sql
-- Query 1: Retrieve paid words based on pwid


SELECT * FROM paidwords WHERE pwid = :pwid;

```

```sql
-- Query 2: Retrieve username and display picture from users based on id


SELECT uname, dp FROM users WHERE id = :id;

```
